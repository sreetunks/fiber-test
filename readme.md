# Minimal Fiber Test

Based on [this](https://graphitemaster.github.io/fibers/) blogpost from Dale Weiler. A minimal context switching example using assembly to store and restore register state on x64 processors.

Currently only targets Windows x64 ABI and compiled with MSVC and MASM.

## WIP
 - Currently the rest of my fiber-based job system is being developed in a private repository but a stripped-down version will be added to this repo as well.
